# Installation
Either download or git-clone the repository. You'll get a directory named `FMGInvSys-master`. Then at the root directory of your project, create a new directory named `Plugins`, if it's not already there. Put `FMGInvSys-master` under the `Plugins` directory. The path to the plugin should look like this: `X:\...\<YourUnrealProject>\Plugins\FMGInvSys-master`.

You may need to re-generate Visual Studio project files, for it to show up in your source code editor.
